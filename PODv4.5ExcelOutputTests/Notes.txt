Notes based on tests performed in local folder.
The following tests were run on PODv4.5.0 before release on 12/22/2022

=======================
Inverse Transform issue
=======================
Inverse transform behaves very wonky. It works, but the user needs to click finish immediately after performing
the inverse transform. If not, PODv4.5 will mark all the points as removed. If using an LR or MLR confidence interval,
Inverse transform removes the very last point in the dataset.

=======================
Application randomly crashing with larger amount of analyses
=======================
The application will randomly crash when larger amount of analyses (>=5) are imported into POD. Sometimes opening a new project and
import new analyses can cause it to crash as well. This could be resolved by switching the application to 64-bit.
*** THis is the exception thrown: System.Reflection.TargetInvocationException: 'Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation.'
=======================
Application crashes when repeatedly clicked the same Analysis
=======================
When I select ranked set sampling while using a standard wald conf int, the application randomly crashes
