Example Data:

HitMissData_a90DNE : example where a90 does not exist (see a90_TooLarge.nb.html)
HitMissData_a90LARGE: example where a90 is too large to be useful in a POD study (see a90_TooLarge.nb.html)
HitMissData_Bad1: example where a90 exists but a9095 does not exist; the corresponding results file gives the fitted models & predicted points for Logit, Lasso and Firth. (Bottom plot in Figure 2 from "Modern Design..." paper)
HitMissData_BadLL: example where the maximum (log) likelihood had issues with estimation, so the converged model results were poor. (Bottom plot in Figure 3 from "Modern Design..." paper)
HitMissData_Good_1: example of well-behaved data; the corresponding results file gives the fitted models & predicted points for Logit, Lasso and Firth. (Top plot in Figure 2 from "Modern Design..." paper)
HitMissData_GoodLL: example of well-behaved data; the maximum (log) likelihood estimation had no problems. (Top plot in Figure 3 from "Modern Design..." paper)
