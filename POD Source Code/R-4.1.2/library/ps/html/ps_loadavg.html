<h2>Return the average system load over the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes as a
tuple.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The “load” represents the processes which are in a runnable
state, either using the CPU or waiting to use the CPU (e.g. waiting for
disk I/O). On Windows this is emulated by using a Windows API that
spawns a thread which keeps running in background and updates results
every 5 seconds, mimicking the UNIX behavior. Thus, on Windows, the
first time this is called and for the next 5 seconds it will return a
meaningless (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) vector. The numbers returned only make sense
if related to the number of CPU cores installed on the system. So, for
instance, a value of 3.14 on a system with 10 logical CPUs means that
the system load was 31.4% percent over the last N minutes.
