<h2>Linear, generalized linear, and nonlinear mixed models</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>lme4</code> provides functions for fitting and analyzing
mixed models: linear (<code><a href="lmer.html">lmer</a></code>), generalized linear
(<code><a href="glmer.html">glmer</a></code>) and nonlinear (<code><a href="nlmer.html">nlmer</a></code>.)
</p>


<h3>Differences between <span class="pkg">nlme</span> and <span class="pkg">lme4</span></h3>

<p><span class="pkg">lme4</span> covers approximately the same ground as the earlier
<span class="pkg">nlme</span> package.  The most important differences are:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><span class="pkg">lme4</span> uses modern, efficient linear algebra methods
as implemented in the <code>Eigen</code> package, and uses reference
classes to avoid undue copying of large objects; it is therefore likely
to be faster and more memory-efficient than <span class="pkg">nlme</span>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><span class="pkg">lme4</span> includes generalized linear mixed model (GLMM)
capabilities, via the <code><a href="glmer.html">glmer</a></code> function.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><span class="pkg">lme4</span> does <em>not</em> currently implement <span class="pkg">nlme</span>'s
features for modeling heteroscedasticity and
correlation of residuals.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><span class="pkg">lme4</span> does not currently offer the same flexibility
as <span class="pkg">nlme</span> for composing complex variance-covariance structures,
but it does implement crossed random effects in a way that
is both easier for the user and much faster.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><span class="pkg">lme4</span> offers built-in facilities for likelihood
profiling and parametric bootstrapping.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><span class="pkg">lme4</span> is designed to be more modular than <span class="pkg">nlme</span>,
making it easier for downstream package developers and end-users
to re-use its components for extensions of the basic mixed model
framework. It also allows more flexibility for specifying
different functions for optimizing over the random-effects
variance-covariance parameters.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><span class="pkg">lme4</span> is not (yet) as well-documented as <span class="pkg">nlme</span>.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Differences between current (1.0.+) and previous versions of
<span class="pkg">lme4</span></h3>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>[gn]lmer</code> now produces objects of class <code><a href="merMod-class.html">merMod</a></code>
rather than class <code>mer</code> as before
</p>
</li>
<li><p> the new version uses a combination of S3 and reference classes
(see <code><a href="../../methods/html/refClass.html">ReferenceClasses</a></code>, <code><a href="merPredD-class.html">merPredD-class</a></code>, and
<code><a href="lmResp-class.html">lmResp-class</a></code>) as well as S4 classes; partly for this reason
it is more interoperable with <span class="pkg">nlme</span>
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The internal structure of [gn]lmer is now more modular, allowing
finer control of the different steps of argument checking; construction
of design matrices and data structures; parameter estimation; and construction
of the final <code>merMod</code> object (see <code><a href="modular.html">modular</a></code>)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> profiling and parametric bootstrapping are new in
the current version
</p>
</li>
<li><p> the new version of <span class="pkg">lme4</span> does <em>not</em> provide
an <code>mcmcsamp</code> (post-hoc MCMC sampling) method, because this
was deemed to be unreliable.  Alternatives for computing p-values
include parametric bootstrapping (<code><a href="bootMer.html">bootMer</a></code>) or methods
implemented in the <span class="pkg">pbkrtest</span> package and leveraged by the
<span class="pkg">lmerTest</span> package and the <code>Anova</code> function in the <span class="pkg">car</span> package
(see <code><a href="pvalues.html">pvalues</a></code> for more details).
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Caveats and trouble-shooting</h3>


<ul>
<li><p> Some users who have previously installed versions of the
RcppEigen and minqa packages may encounter segmentation faults (!!);
the solution is to make sure to re-install these packages before
installing <span class="pkg">lme4</span>.  (Because the problem is not with the
explicit <em>version</em> of the packages, but with running
packages that were built with different versions of <span class="pkg">Rcpp</span>
in conjunction with each other, simply making sure you have
the latest version, or using <code>update.packages</code>, will
not necessarily solve the problem; you must actually re-install
the packages. The problem is most likely with <span class="pkg">minqa</span>.)
</p>
</li></ul>
