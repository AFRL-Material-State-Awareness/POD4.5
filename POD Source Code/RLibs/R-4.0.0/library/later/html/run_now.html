<h2>Execute scheduled operations</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Normally, operations scheduled with <code><a href="later.html">later()</a></code> will not execute unless/until
no other R code is on the stack (i.e. at the top-level). If you need to run
blocking R code for a long time and want to allow scheduled operations to run
at well-defined points of your own operation, you can call <code>run_now()</code> at
those points and any operations that are due to run will do so.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
run_now(timeoutSecs = 0L, all = TRUE, loop = current_loop())
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>timeoutSecs</code></td>
<td>
<p>Wait (block) for up to this number of seconds waiting for
an operation to be ready to run. If <code>0</code>, then return immediately if there
are no operations that are ready to run. If <code>Inf</code> or negative, then wait as
long as it takes (if none are scheduled, then this will block forever).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>all</code></td>
<td>
<p>If <code>FALSE</code>, <code>run_now()</code> will execute at most one scheduled
operation (instead of all eligible operations). This can be useful in cases
where you want to interleave scheduled operations with your own logic.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>loop</code></td>
<td>
<p>A handle to an event loop. Defaults to the currently-active loop.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If one of the callbacks throws an error, the error will <em>not</em> be caught, and
subsequent callbacks will not be executed (until <code>run_now()</code> is called again,
or control returns to the R prompt). You must use your own
<a href="../../base/html/conditions.html">tryCatch</a> if you want to handle errors.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A logical indicating whether any callbacks were actually run.
