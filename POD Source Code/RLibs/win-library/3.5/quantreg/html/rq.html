<h2>
Quantile Regression 
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Returns an object of class <code>"rq"</code> <code>"rqs"</code> 
or <code>"rq.process"</code> that represents a quantile regression fit. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
rq(formula, tau=.5, data, subset, weights, na.action,
   method="br", model = TRUE, contrasts, ...) 
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>formula</code></td>
<td>

<p>a formula object, with the response on the left of a <code>~</code> operator, 
and the terms, separated by <code>+</code> operators, on the right. 
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>tau</code></td>
<td>

<p>the quantile(s) to be estimated, this is generally a number strictly between 0 and 1, 
but if specified strictly outside this range, it is presumed that the solutions 
for all values of <code>tau</code> in (0,1) are desired.  In the former case an
object of class <code>"rq"</code> is returned, in the latter,
an object of class <code>"rq.process"</code> is returned.  As of version 3.50,
tau can also be a vector of values between 0 and 1; in this case an
object of class <code>"rqs"</code> is returned containing among other things
a matrix of coefficient estimates at the specified quantiles.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>data</code></td>
<td>

<p>a data.frame in which to interpret the variables 
named in the formula, or in the subset and the weights argument. 
If this is missing, then the variables in the formula should be on the 
search list.  This may also be a single number to handle some special  
cases &ndash; see below for details.   
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>subset</code></td>
<td>

<p>an optional vector specifying a subset of observations to be
used in the fitting process.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>weights</code></td>
<td>

<p>vector of observation weights; if supplied, the algorithm fits
to minimize the sum of the weights multiplied into the
absolute residuals. The length of weights must be the same as
the number of observations.  The weights must be nonnegative
and it is strongly recommended that they be strictly positive,
since zero weights are ambiguous. 
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>na.action</code></td>
<td>

<p>a function to filter missing data. 
This is applied to the model.frame after any subset argument has been used. 
The default (with <code>na.fail</code>) is to create an error if any missing values are  
found.  A possible alternative is <code>na.omit</code>, which 
deletes observations that contain one or more missing values. 
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>model</code></td>
<td>
<p>if TRUE then the model frame is returned.  This is
essential if one wants to call summary subsequently.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>method</code></td>
<td>

<p>the algorithmic method used to compute the fit.  There are several
options:   
</p>

<ol>
<li> <p><code>"br"</code> The default method is the modified  version of the
Barrodale and Roberts algorithm for <i>l1</i>-regression,
used by <code>l1fit</code> in S, and is described in detail in 
Koenker and d'Orey(1987, 1994),  default = <code>"br"</code>. 
This is quite efficient for problems up to several thousand observations, 
and may be used to compute the full quantile regression process.  It 
also implements a scheme for computing confidence intervals for 
the estimated parameters, based on inversion of a rank test described 
in Koenker(1994).  
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"fn"</code> For larger problems it is advantageous to use 
the Frisch&ndash;Newton interior point method <code>"fn"</code>. 
This is described in detail in Portnoy and Koenker(1997).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"pfn"</code> For even larger problems one can use the Frisch&ndash;Newton approach after 
preprocessing <code>"pfn"</code>.  Also described in detail in Portnoy and Koenker(1997), 
this method is primarily well-suited for large n, small p problems, that is when the 
parametric dimension of the model is modest.  
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"sfn"</code>  For large problems with  large
parametric dimension it is often advantageous to use method <code>"sfn"</code>
which also uses the Frisch-Newton algorithm, but exploits sparse algebra
to compute iterates.  This is especially helpful when the model includes
factor variables that, when expanded, generate design matrices that
are very sparse.  At present options for inference, i.e. summary methods
are somewhat limited when using the <code>"sfn"</code> method.  Only the option
<code>se = "nid"</code> is currently available, but I hope to implement some
bootstrap options in the near future.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"fnc"</code>  Another option enables the user to specify
linear inequality constraints on the fitted coefficients; in this
case one needs to specify the matrix <code>R</code> and the vector <code>r</code>
representing the constraints in the form <i>Rb &ge;q r</i>.  See the
examples below.  
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"conquer"</code>  For very large problems especially those with
large parametric dimension, this option provides a link to the <span class="pkg">conquer</span>
of He, Pan, Tan, and Zhou (2020).  Calls to <code>summary</code> when the fitted
object is computed with this option invoke the multiplier bootstrap percentile
method of the <span class="pkg">conquer</span> package and can be considerably quicker than other
options when the problem size is large.  Further options for this fitting
method are described in the <span class="pkg">conquer</span> package.  Note that this option
employs a smoothing form of the usual QR objective function so solutions
may be expected to differ somewhat from those produced with the other options.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"pfnb"</code> This option is intended for applications with large
sample sizes and/or moderately fine tau grids.  It uses a form of preprocessing
to accelerate the solution process.  The loop over taus occurs inside the Fortran
call and there should be more efficient than other methods in large problems.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"qfnb"</code> This option is like the preceeding one except that it doesn't
use the preprocessing option.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"ppro"</code> This option is an R prototype of the <code>pfnb</code> and is 
offered for historical/interpretative purposes, but probably should be considered
deprecated.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"lasso"</code> There are two penalized methods:  <code>"lasso"</code> 
and <code>"scad"</code> that implement the lasso penalty and Fan and Li
smoothly clipped absolute deviation penalty, respectively.  These
methods should probably be regarded as experimental.  Note:  weights
are ignored when the method is penalized.
</p>
</li></ol>

</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>contrasts</code></td>
<td>

<p>a list giving contrasts for some or all of the factors 
default = <code>NULL</code> appearing in the model formula. 
The elements of the list should have the same name as the variable 
and should be either a contrast matrix (specifically, any full-rank 
matrix with as many rows as there are levels in the factor), 
or else a function to compute such a matrix given the number of levels. 
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>

<p>additional arguments for the fitting routines 
(see <code><a href="rq.fit.br.html">rq.fit.br</a></code> and <code><a href="rq.fit.fnb.html">rq.fit.fnb</a></code>, etc.
and the functions they call).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For further details see the vignette available from <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> with
<code> vignette("rq",package="quantreg")</code> and/or the Koenker (2005).
For estimation of nonlinear (in parameters) quantile regression models
there is the function <code>nlrq</code> and for nonparametric additive 
quantile regression there is the function <code>rqss</code>.
Fitting of quantile regression models with censored data is handled by the
<code>crq</code> function.</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>See <code><a href="rq.object.html">rq.object</a></code> and <code><a href="rq.process.object.html">rq.process.object</a></code> for details. 
Inferential matters are handled with <code><a href="../../base/html/summary.html">summary</a></code>.  There are
extractor methods <code>logLik</code> and <code>AIC</code> that are potentially
relevant for model selection.
</p>


<h3>Method</h3>

<p>The function computes an estimate on the tau-th conditional quantile
function of the response, given the covariates, as specified by the
formula argument.  Like <code>lm()</code>, the function presumes a linear
specification for the quantile regression model, i.e. that the formula
defines a model that is linear in parameters.  For non-linear (in parameters)
quantile regression see the package <code>nlrq()</code>.  
The function minimizes a weighted sum of absolute
residuals that can be formulated as a linear programming problem.  As
noted above, there are several different algorithms that can be chosen
depending on problem size and other characteristics.  For moderate sized
problems (<i>n &lt;&lt; 5,000, p &lt;&lt; 20</i>) it is recommended 
that the default <code>"br"</code> method be used. There are several choices of methods for
computing confidence intervals and associated test statistics.  
See the documentation for <code><a href="summary.rq.html">summary.rq</a></code> for further details
and options.
