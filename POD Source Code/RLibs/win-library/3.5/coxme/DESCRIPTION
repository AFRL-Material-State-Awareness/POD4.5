Description: Fit Cox proportional hazards models containing both 
 fixed and random effects.  The random effects can have a general form, of which
 familial interactions (a "kinship" matrix) is a particular special case. 
 Note that the simplest case of a mixed effects Cox model, i.e. a single random 
 per-group intercept, is also called a "frailty" model.  The approach is based
 on Ripatti and Palmgren, Biometrics 2002.
