<h2>
Draw arcs
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Given starting and ending points on a sphere and the center of the
sphere, draw the
great circle arc between the starting and ending points.  If
the starting and ending points have different radii, a segment of a
logarithmic spiral will join them.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
arc3d(from, to, center, radius, n, circle = 50, base = 0,
plot = TRUE, ...)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>from</code></td>
<td>

<p>One or more points from which to start arcs.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>to</code></td>
<td>

<p>One or more destination points.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>center</code></td>
<td>

<p>One or more center points.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>radius</code></td>
<td>

<p>If not missing, a vector of length <code>n</code> giving the
radii at each point between <code>from</code> and <code>to</code>.
If missing, the starting and ending points will be joined by
a logarithmic spiral.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>n</code></td>
<td>

<p>If not missing, how many segments to use between the first and last point.  If missing, a value will be calculated based on the
angle between starting and ending points as seen from the center.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>circle</code></td>
<td>

<p>How many segments would be used if the arc went completely around
a circle.

</td></tr>

<p>See Details below.

<p>Should the arcs be plotted, or returned as a matrix?

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If any of <code>from</code>, <code>to</code> or <code>center</code> is an n by 3
matrix with n &gt; 1, multiple arcs will be drawn by recycling
each of these parameters to the number of rows of the longest
one.
</p>
<p>If the vector lengths of <code>from - center</code> and
<code>to - center</code> differ, then instead of a spherical
arc, the function will draw a segment of a logarithmic spiral joining
the two points.
</p>
<p>By default, the arc is drawn along the shortest great 
circle path from <code>from</code> to <code>to</code>, but the
<code>base</code> parameter can be used to modify this.  
If <code>base = 1</code> is used, the longer arc will be followed.
Larger positive integer values will result in <code>base - 1</code>
loops in that direction completely around the sphere.  
Negative values will draw the curve in the same direction
as the shortest arc, but with <code>abs(base)</code> full loops.
It doesn't make much sense to ask for such loops unless
the radii of <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> differ, because
spherical arcs would overlap.
Normally the <code>base</code> parameter is left at its default
value of <code>0</code>.  
</p>
<p>When <code>base</code> is non-zero, the curve will be constructed in multiple
pieces, between <code>from</code>, <code>to</code>, <code>-from</code> and <code>-to</code>,
for as many steps as necessary.  If <code>n</code> is specified, it
will apply to each of these pieces.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If <code>plot = TRUE</code>, called mainly for the side effect of drawing arcs.  Invisibly
returns the object ID of the collection of arcs. 
</p>
<p>If <code>plot = FALSE</code>, returns a 3 column matrix containing
the points that would be drawn as the arcs.
