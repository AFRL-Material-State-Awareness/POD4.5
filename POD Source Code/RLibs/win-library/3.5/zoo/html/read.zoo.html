<h2>Reading and Writing zoo Series</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>read.zoo</code> and <code>write.zoo</code> are convenience functions for reading
and writing <code>"zoo"</code> series from/to text files. They are convenience
interfaces to <code>read.table</code> and <code>write.table</code>, respectively.
To employ <code>read.csv</code>, <code>read.csv2</code>, <code>read.delim</code>,
<code>read.delim2</code> instead of <code>read.table</code> additional functions
<code>read.csv.zoo</code> etc. are provided.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
read.zoo(file, format = "", tz = "", FUN = NULL,
  regular = FALSE, index.column = 1, drop = TRUE, FUN2 = NULL,
  split = NULL, aggregate = FALSE, ..., text, read = read.table)
  
write.zoo(x, file = "", index.name = "Index", row.names = FALSE, col.names = NULL, ...)

read.csv.zoo(..., read = read.csv)
read.csv2.zoo(..., read = read.csv2)
read.delim.zoo(..., read = read.delim)
read.delim2.zoo(..., read = read.delim2)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>file</code></td>
<td>
<p>character string or strings giving the name of the file(s) 
which the data
are to be read from/written to. See <code><a href="../../utils/html/read.table.html">read.table</a></code> and
<code><a href="../../utils/html/write.table.html">write.table</a></code> for more information. Alternatively,
in <code>read.zoo</code>, <code>file</code> can be a <code>connection</code> or a
<code>data.frame</code> (e.g.,
resulting from a previous <code>read.table</code> call) that
is subsequently processed to a <code>"zoo"</code> series.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>format</code></td>
<td>
<p>date format argument passed to <code>FUN</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>tz</code></td>
<td>
<p>time zone argument passed to <code><a href="../../base/html/as.POSIXlt.html">as.POSIXct</a></code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>FUN</code></td>
<td>
<p>a function for computing the index from the first column
of the data. See details.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>regular</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical. Should the series be coerced to class <code>"zooreg"</code>
(if the series is regular)?</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>index.column</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric vector or list. The column names or numbers of the data frame 
in which the index/time is stored.  If the <code>read.table</code> argument <code>colClasses</code> 
is used and <code>"NULL"</code> is among its components then 
<code>index.column</code> refers to the column numbers after the columns 
corresponding to <code>"NULL"</code> in <code>colClasses</code> have been removed.  
If specified as a list then one argument will be passed to argument <code>FUN</code> per component so that, 
for example, <code>index.column = list(1, 2)</code> will cause 
<code>FUN(x[,1], x[,2], ...)</code> to be called whereas 
<code>index.column = list(1:2)</code> will cause 
<code>FUN(x[,1:2], ...)</code> to be called where <code>x</code> is a data frame of 
characters data.  Here <code>...</code> refers to <code>format</code>
and/or <code>tz</code>, if they specified as arguments.  <code>index.column = 0</code> can
be used to specify that the row names be used as the index.  In the case that
no row names were input sequential numbering is used.
If <code>index.column</code> is specified as an ordinary vector then if it has the
same length as the number of arguments of <code>FUN</code> (or <code>FUN2</code> in the
event that <code>FUN2</code> is specified and <code>FUN</code> is not) 
then <code>index.column</code> is converted to a
list.  Also it is always converted to a list if it has length 1.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>drop</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical. If the data frame contains just a single data column, should
the second dimension be dropped?</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>a <code>"zoo"</code> object.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>index.name</code></td>
<td>
<p>character with name of the index column in the written
data file.</p>
</td></tr>  
<tr valign="top"><td><code>row.names</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical. Should row names be written? Default is <code>FALSE</code>
because the row names are just character representations of the index.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>col.names</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical. Should column names be written? Default is to
write column names only if <code>x</code> has column names.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>FUN2</code></td>
<td>
<p>function. It is applied to the time index after 
<code>FUN</code> and before <code>aggregate</code>. If <code>FUN</code> is not specified
but <code>FUN2</code> is specified then only <code>FUN2</code> is applied.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>split</code></td>
<td>
<p>NULL or column number or name or vector of numbers or 
names. If not NULL then the data is assumed to be in long format and is 
split according to the indicated columns.  See the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> 
<code><a href="../../stats/html/reshape.html">reshape</a></code> command for description of long data.
If <code>split = Inf</code> then the first of each run among the times are made into
a separate series, the second of each run and so on.  If <code>split= -Inf</code> then
the last of each run is made into a separate series, the second last
and so on.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>aggregate</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical or function. If set to <code>TRUE</code>, then <code><a href="aggregate.zoo.html">aggregate.zoo</a></code>
is applied to the zoo object created to compute the <code><a href="../../base/html/mean.html">mean</a></code> of all values with
the same time index. Alternatively, <code>aggregate</code> can be set to any other
function that should be used for aggregation.
If <code>FALSE</code> (the default), no aggregation is performed and a warning
is given if there are any duplicated time indexes.  Note that most
<code>zoo</code> functions do not accept objects with duplicate time indexes.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>read.zoo</code> is a convenience function which should make it easier
to read data from a text file and turn it into a <code>"zoo"</code> series 
immediately. <code>read.zoo</code> reads the data file via <code>read.table(file, ...)</code>.
The column <code>index.column</code> (by default the first) of the resulting data is
interpreted to be the index/time, the remaining columns the corresponding data.
(If the file only has only column then that is assumed to be the data column and
<code>1, 2, ...</code> are used for the index.)  To assign the appropriate class
to the index, <code>FUN</code> can be specified and is applied to the first column.
</p>
<p>To process the index, <code>read.zoo</code> calls <code>FUN</code> with the index as the
first argument. If <code>FUN</code> is not specified, the following default is employed:
</p>
<p>(a) If <code>file</code> is a data frame with a single
index column that appears to be a time index already, then <code>FUN = identity</code> is used.
The conditions for a readily produced time index are: It is not <code>character</code> or 
<code>factor</code> (and the arguments <code>tz</code> and <code>format</code> must not be specified).
</p>
<p>(b) If the conditions from (a) do not hold then the following strategy is used.
If there are multiple index columns they are pasted together with a space between each.
Using the (pasted) index column: (1) If <code>tz</code> is specified then the
index column is converted to <code>POSIXct</code>.  (2) If <code>format</code> is specified
then the index column is converted to <code>Date</code>. (3) Otherwise, a heuristic
attempts to decide between <code>"numeric"</code>, <code>"POSIXct"</code>, and <code>"Date"</code> by
trying them in that order (which may not always succeed though). By default,
only the standard date/time format is used. Hence, supplying <code>format</code> and/or <code>tz</code>
is necessary if some date/time format is used that is not the default. And even
if the default format is appropriate for the index, explicitly supplying
<code>FUN</code> or at least <code>format</code> and/or <code>tz</code> typically leads to more
reliable results than the heuristic.
</p>
<p>If <code>regular</code> is set to <code>TRUE</code> and the resulting series has an 
underlying regularity, it is coerced to a <code>"zooreg"</code> series.
</p>
<p>To employ other functions than <code>read.table</code> to read the initial data,
further convenience interfaces <code>read.csv.zoo</code> etc. are provided.
</p>
<p><code>write.zoo</code> is a convenience function for writing <code>"zoo"</code> series
to text files. It first coerces its argument to a <code>"data.frame"</code>, adds
a column with the index and then calls <code><a href="../../utils/html/write.table.html">write.table</a></code>.
</p>
<p>See also <code>vignette("zoo-read", package = "zoo")</code> for detailed examples.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>read.zoo</code> returns an object of class <code>"zoo"</code> (or <code>"zooreg"</code>).
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p><code>read.zoo</code> works by first reading the data in using <code>read.table</code>
and then processing it.  This implies that 
if the index field is entirely numeric the default is to pass it to <code>FUN</code>
or the built-in date conversion routine
a number, rather than a character string. 
Thus, a date field such as <code>09122007</code> intended
to represent December 12, 2007 would be seen as <code>9122007</code>
and interpreted as the 91st day 
thereby generating an error.  
</p>
<p>This comment also applies to trailing decimals so that if 
<code>2000.10</code> were intended to represent the 10th month of 2000 in fact
it would receive
<code>2000.1</code> and regard it as the first month of 2000
unless similar precautions were taken.
</p>
<p>In the above cases the index field should be specified to be
<code>"character"</code> so that leading or trailing zeros
are not dropped.  This can be done by specifying a <code>"character"</code>
index column in the 
<code>"colClasses"</code> argument, which is passed to <code>read.table</code>, 
as shown in the examples below.
